            There isn't much in IceStone that you'd want to photograph and then if you did, you definitely wouldn't feel
            like showing it off online. You would get good lighting but not even that could help. There was a lack of
            extravagance.

        <p class = "paraText" >
            IceStone felt expensive. Dessert Bars should make you feel full, not the roast dinner kinda full, but the I've had 15 creme
            eggs please don't feed me ever again kind of full. You don't get this joyfully regretful feeling from IceStone but this is certainly
            not reflected in the price they expect you to pay.

        <h2>Cookie Dough - 4/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            "4!? That's generous!" what the actual response I received when I showed my Desserted partner my score for
            IceStone's Cookie Dough. It wasn't especially bad in flavour, the problem was it was like eating paper. There was
            a very noticeable lack of depth, which was almost rubbed in our faces by how tall the edges of the dishes are that
            they cook it in. I've had thicker pancakes - enough said.

        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            IceStone Gelato have a few restaurants (the website calls them stores for some reason) dotted about, I haven't
            counted but it looks to be in-between Tamu and Creams in terms of Cafe-Count. I have only been to the Leeds
            parlour, and I don't feel like risking it and seeing if the others are any better. I wrote this sentence and
            randomly chose which word would be the link <a href = "https://www.icestonegelato.co.uk/">to</a> their website.

        <h2>Shakes - 7/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Indifference is the overriding emotion when it comes to IceStone shakes. I remember having Strawberry Cheesecake,
            there was a look of impressed shock when there were digestive biscuits in the milkshake and there was an acceptable
            depth of strawberry cheesecake flavour. The only problem was that they were tiny, like Happy Meal drink sized. In short:
            Nice taste, too small. Note: FreakShakes (such as the one pictured) do not count, nice try.

        <h2>Feng Shui - 8/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Much time has been spent pondering over whether 7 or 8 is a fair score for this one. I won't actually put the number
            in case I end up changing it in the heading and forgetting I wrote it down here. This situation would usually involve
            scoring 7.5 but I decided when I started that I would only use whole numbers and here we are - rules are rules.
            This already has a fair amount of text and I haven't explain any of the Feng Shui, and the more I write the worse it gets!
            The seats are a pinky velvet material and the tables are like a dark brown laminate flooring. It looks a bit better than
            it sounds.
