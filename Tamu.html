        <p class = "paraText" >
            Tamu can be found on Cowgate, Peterborough. Their website doesn't work currently (March 2019) and I couldn't find a
            link to their menu anywhere until I went on Google Images. So, if you click
            <a href = "https://tamudessertslounge.com//">here</a> then you will be transported their website (I think).

        <h2>Instagrammability - 9/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            If you clicked on the link in the Background Info above, you might have already seen this one coming. Tamu's
            desserts look good. Like really good.

        <h2>Make it Rain - 8/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Considering the quality and size of the goods at Tamu, their prices are very similar to their competitors, and
            their Cookie Dough is scrumdiddlyumptious (spoilers) so they score highly here. Happily take my money.

        <h2>Cookie Dough - 10/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Heaven in an oven dish. Not only do they provide amazing Cookie Dough, for Â£1.50 you can 'Supersize It' and get
            an even bigger one! Peng.

    <div class = "paraDiv">
        <h2>Shakes - 8/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Although Tamu don't have a massive range of ice creams (the cliche ones mainly), it's the quality of their shakes
            that earn the points here. Big, thick and flavoursome.

        <h2>Feng Shui - 6/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            No one can be perfect. Tamu looks good from the outside and smells almost sickeningly sweet from the inside,
            however, it does fall down when it comes to furnishings. There are only a few booths and the rest are small tables with
            uncomfortable chairs. Also there's no toilet... At least the food's good.
