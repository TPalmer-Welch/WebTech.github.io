    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>
        Tamu can be found on Cowgate, Peterborough. Their website doesn't work currently (March 2019) and I can't find a
        link to their menu anywhere unfortunately. However, if you click
        <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/tamuonline/">here</a> then you will be transported their Facebook page.

<div>
    <h2>Instagrammability - 9/10</h2>
    <p>
        If you clicked on the link in the Background Info above, you might have already seen this one coming. Tamu's
        desserts look good. Like really good.

    <h2>Make it Rain - 8/10</h2>
    <p>
        Considering the quality and size of the goods at Tamu, their prices are very similar to their competitors, and
        their Cookie Dough is nicer (spoilers) so the score highly here. Happily take my money.

<div>
    <h2>Cookie Dough - 10/10</h2>
    <p>
        Heaven in an oven dish. Not only do they provide amazing Cookie Dough for Â£1.50 you can 'Supersize It' and get
        an even bigger one! Peng.

<div>
    <h2>Shakes - 8/10</h2>
    <p>
        Although Tamu don't have a massive range of ice creams (the cliche ones mainly), its the quality of their shakes
        that earn the points here. Big, thick and flavoursome.

<div>
    <h2>Feng Shui - 6/10</h2>
    <p>
        No one can be perfect. Tamu looks good from the outside and smells almost sickening sweet from the inside
        it does fall down when it comes to furnishings. There are only a few booths and the rest are small tables with
        uncomfortable chairs. Also theirs no toilet... At least the food's good.
