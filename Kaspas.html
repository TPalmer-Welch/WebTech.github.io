        <h2>Instagrammability - 10/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Searching for #kaspas on Instagram brings up 56.3k posts (March 2019). Thats a lot of posts. The decoration that comes with
            each dessert is top notch, so much that social media-ing it is now part of the Kaspa's experience. Cheese.

            Kaspa's had slightly higher-end prices compared to the rest, despite having good food - it's not the best.
            Although it is a bit more expensive it's still worth the money. Not rain, but definitely drizzle.

            An average entry from Kaspa's here, they have more options to mess around with your Biscuit Mix, but I'd rather
            1 premium dough instead of 5 average ones.

        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Kaspa's is bigger than Tamu and has a LOT of restaurants across the UK. I've been to both the one in
            Peterborough and the one in Leeds and can safely say the Peterborough is nicer. This review focuses on the
            experience in Peterborough as it was actually quite good. Oh, <a href = "https://kaspas.co.uk/">this</a> is
            their website.

        <h2>Shakes - 8/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            A frankly remarkable selection of ice creams. This means you can have a wide variety of milkshakes. I haven't
            had a shake that hasn't tasted as I expected but is a Bakewell Tart milkshake really a good idea?

    <div class = "plate plate5">
        <h2>Feng Shui - 9/10</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Kaspa's looks the part. Nothing says glam more than glittery black surfaces and pink upholstery. Not only is the
            food gonna look good on Snapchat so will it's surroundings. Like a supermodel having a photo shoot in the Rocky
            Mountains.
