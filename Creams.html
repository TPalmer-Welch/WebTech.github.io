            Your order from Creams isn't photogenic. It feels as if it should be but it lacks pizzazz (yes that is a word,
            Google it). I'm not a photographer so I can't provide helpful tips, hopefully they do find one who will.

            "It's not the cheapest here, is it?", is never a great thing to here halfway through your Cookie Dough. It's
            greatness increases somewhat if you can answer with "I know, but you can see why". This got 6 out of 10.

            Creams and Cookie Dough are not a tasty combination. It's clear they've gone for bigger is better. The problem
            here is that when a Cookie Dough starts to rise as much as the ones here do, you end with a cake. This could
            be salvaged (to an extent) if there was a generous amount of gooey-ness from the chocolate chips, it wasn't.

            I was today years old when I found out that there are a fair amount of Creams restaurants around the UK. As
            you'll see, this is quite surprising based off my Peterborough experience.
            <a href = "https://www.creamscafe.com/">Click me</a> to arrive at their website. Making sure that link works was
            the first time I found out they do Bubble Pop Waffles, a lot of learning was done today.

            As a naturally positive person, I'm (figuratively) a glass half full kinda guy. However, Creams managed to turn
            this saying into a reality as whatever I ordered definitely didn't pass the 50% mark - a very rare occasion.

            Creams have seemed to take their notebooks when trying out Kaspa's. A very similar colour scheme and layout with
            comfortable seats make for an enjoyable sitting experience. Also all the walls on the toilet walls were mirrors.
            I couldn't find of (or think of) any mirror jokes. I'll put this in the self-reflection part of the report.
