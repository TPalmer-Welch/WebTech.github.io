        <h2>Cookie Dough</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Some might define this category as 'Biscuit Mix', but no one really calls Cookie Dough 'Biscuit Mix'.
            When judging a Dessert Cafe, only 1 dish is worth focusing any attention on and that is the almighty
            Cookie Dough. It's hard to describe the perfect cookie dough, its a heavenly balance of gooey-ness,
            thick-ness, sweet-ness, chocolately-ness and sticky-ness. If they master the best Cookie Dough, the other
            categories almost become meaningless.

        <h2>Instagrammability</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Some might define this category as 'Appearance' or 'Presentation', but those words exist in a
            dictionary and therefore too boring. A cafe's Instagrammability is how how likely you would be to upload
            your order to social media - to show off to the world the calories your about to consume. Not only does
            a particularly good looking dessert provide endless bragging rights but in the famous words of Richard
            Hammond, when garnishing Deep Fried Spaghetti Bolognese with Walkers Crisps, 'Sometimes, we eat with our
            eyes'. Well said.

        <h2>Make it Rain</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Some might define this category as 'Cost' or maybe even 'Value for Money', but again, at Desserted
            we take reviewing very seriously and do not associate ourselves with standard heading names. For a
            restaurant to score highly in this area, they must provide desserts that one enjoys so much that the price
            becomes irrelevant, or, when describing your experience with a friend and you mention the price, a look of
            intrigued (almost envious) shock develops on their face - not an easy feat.

        <h2>Desserted</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >Desserted is website dedicated to reviewing Dessert Cafes. Currently, only 4 restaurants
            have been reviewed, but I needed 5 pages for this coursework so 4 will do. When reviewing a food based
            establishment, there must some criteria that each diner must be judged upon. Great experience with eating
            desserts have led to the formulation of 5 important categories (see below) that will be used as our
            marking scheme for each parlour's examination.</p>

    <div class = "plate plate4">
        <h2>Shakes</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Some might define this category as 'Milkshakes' or 'Sip it Slowly to Stop Brainfreeze', but in the
            extensive effort to be more efficient, 'Shakes' will do. This category also covers the Ice Creams on offer
            in each restaurant as they all offer milkshakes made with various scoops of their ice creams. Points are
            gained here for variety, thickness, taste and size, typically, the higher the better.

        <h2>Feng Shui</h2>
        <p class = "paraText" >
            Some might define this category as 'Internal Design' or 'Inside' but these aren't dramatic enough to
            be in a h2 tag. This category focuses on how nice each cafe is to sit and eat in, regardless of the
            quality of the food. Areas that are considered are the tables and chairs, bar area, walls, floors and
            toilet facilities. Ultimately - is it a nice place to be in.
